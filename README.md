# punk.Pseudo3D
A HaxePunk addon for rendering pseudo 3D objects. 

This can be used to create a lot of different styles and types of games. For example...

* A top-down adventure with a free moving camera
* A sideview diorama-like platformer perhaps like Luigi's Mansion
* A vanishing point racing game in the veins of Outrun

## Pseudo 3D?

I think an animation explains it best.

I want to thank Louis Gorenfeld for the amazing research they provided. I don't think I could have figured this out without Lou's Pseudo 3d Page.
I also want to give my thanks to Moppin & Nemk for making NIUM, which inspired me to create all of this in the first place.

And thanks a lot to [abetusk](https://mechaelephant.com/) and [sanglorian](https://opengameart.org/users/sanglorian) for their support.
